Interval cover: https://open.kattis.com/problems/intervalcover
Emil SÃ¤ll
The code is written in C++ and is using the Google C++ style guide.

This code is used to solve the interval cover problem. The problem is to find the minimal number of 
intervals that covers a target interval. The input is a set of intervals and a target interval. The 
output is the minimal number of intervals that covers the target interval and which intervals that are
used. 

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) where n is the number of intervals.

The input is row dependent, the first row are two floats separated by a space, the first float is
the lower bound of the interval and the second float is the upper bound of the interval. The second 
row is an integer n, which are the number of intervals in the set of intervals that are checked to 
cover the target interval. The next n rows are two floats separated by a space which similarily as 
the target interval are the lower and upper bound of the intervals. The output is the minimal number
of intervals that covers the target interval and which intervals that are used indexed as they were
input in the program. If the target interval cannot be covered the output is "impossible". The 
program can take multiple testcases as input. as long as they follow eachother directly. A example of
input and output is shown below.

Input:
-0.5 1
3
-0.9 -0.1
-0.2 2
-0.7 1
0 1
3
0 0.25
0.25 0.75
0.75 0.999

Output:
1
2
impossible
