Problem: Polygon Area - https://open.kattis.com/problems/polygonarea
Author: Emil SÃ¤ll
The code is written in C++ and is using the Google C++ style guide.

This code is used to compute the area of a simple polygon in which 
its vertices are given.

The time complexity of the program is O(n) where n is the number of 
vertices in the input. All the operators for the Class Coordinate has
constant time complexity. The function polygon_area has the time 
complexity O(n) since it loops through all the given vertices. 

The input could be up to 25 test cases. Every case starts with an 
integer n on the first row.Then follow n vertices of a simple polygon
on each line on the form x y. The points are given in either 
clockwise or counterclockwise order. The input is terminated but a 
row with a single 0.

The output for every polygon (test case) is on the form D A on one 
row. Where D is either CW for clockwise or CCW for counterclockwise 
and A is the area of the polygon given with exactly one digit after 
the decimal point. Below follow examples of input and corresponding 
output.

Input:
3
0 0
10 0
0 10
5
41 -6
-24 -74
-51 -6
73 17
-30 -34
0

Output:	
CCW 50.0
CW 3817.5
