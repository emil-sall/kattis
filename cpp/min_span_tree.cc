Minimum spanning tree: https://open.kattis.com/problems/minspantree
Author: Emil SÃ¤ll
The code is written in C++ and is using the Google C++ style guide.

This code is used to solve the minimum spanning tree problem. The problem is to find the 
minimum-weighted tree that connects all the vertices in a graph. The input is several 
test cases and each test case input is the edges of the graph.

The time complexity of the program is O(E * log(E)) where E is the number of edges in the graph.
This is because the program is sorting the edges based on the weights and the sorting takes O(E * log(E)).
The sorting is done with the standard library function std::sort which is using the algorithm introsort
which is a combination of quicksort, heapsort and insertion sort. The rest of the operations have a lower
time complexity, parts as the union-find operations and actually constructing the tree.


The input of each test case is row dependent, the first row are two integers separated by a space, 
the first integer is the number of nodes n in the graph and the second integer is the number of edges m.
The next m rows are three integers separated by a space, the first integer is the first node of the edge,
the second integer is the second node of the edge and the third integer is the weight of the edge.

The output for each test case is first a row with one integer which is the cost of the minimum spanning
tree. The next n-1 rows are all the edges in the minimum spanning tree, each row is two integers separated
by a space, the first integer is the first node of the edge and the second integer is the second node of
the edge. If there is no minium spanning tree, the output should be "Impossible". An example of input and
output is shown below.

Input:
4 4
0 1 1
1 2 2
1 3 3
2 3 0
2 1
0 1 100
3 0
0 0

Output:
3
0 1
1 2
2 3
100
0 1
Impossible
