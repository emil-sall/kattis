Problem: Single source shortest path, non-negative weights - https://open.kattis.com/problems/shortestpath1
Author: Emil SÃ¤ll
The code is written in C++ and is using the Google C++ style guide.

This code is used to solve the single source shortest path problem. The problem is to find the 
shortest path where the problems are restricted to have only one source. The input is several 
test cases.

The time complexity of the program is O(E log(V)) where E is the number of edges and V is the 
number of vertices.  

The input of each test case is row dependent, the first row are four integers separated by a space, 
the first integer is the number of nodes n in the graph, the second integer is the number of edges m, 
the third is the number of queries q and the fourth is the source node s. The next m rows are three
integers separated by a space, the first integer is the first node of the edge, the second integer is
the second node of the edge and the third integer is the weight of the edge. The next q rows are one
integer which is the node that we want to find the shortest path to from the source node.

The output for each test case is one row per test case that has one integer which is the shortest path
to the node from the source node. If there is no path to the node, the output should be "Impossible".
Between test cases the output should be an empty row. An example of input and output is shown below.

Input:
4 3 4 0
0 1 2
1 2 2
3 0 2
0
1
2
3
2 1 1 0
0 1 100
1
0 0 0 0

Output:
0
2
4
Impossible

100
